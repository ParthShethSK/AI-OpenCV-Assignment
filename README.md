# Computer Vision Ball Tracking

This program utilizes Computer Vision to track the movement of balls of different colors across various quadrants in the provided video. The script records events for each ball entering and exiting numbered quadrants, storing the data in a specified format:

Time, Quadrant Number, Ball Colour, Type (Entry or Exit)


## Prerequisites
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- CSV

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas
```

### 2. Run the Code

To execute this Jupyter Notebook and run all the code cells, follow these steps:

**Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing this notebook file (`ai-assignment.ipynb`). Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
## Code Overview

### Basic Details and Visualization

It provides the fundamental functionality for tracking balls in the video. It uses Computer Vision techniques to identify balls of different colors and visualize their movement across various quadrants. The script utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.

#### Highlights:

- **Color Highlighting:** The script highlights balls based on their color using the HSV color space.
- **Contour Detection:** Contours are detected to find the most significant contour representing each ball.
- **Centroid Visualization:** The centroid of each significant contour is visualized on the frame.
- **Original vs. Highlighted Frames:** The script generates visualizations of the original frame alongside the frame with highlighted balls.

Feel free to adjust color ranges and quadrant coordinates based on your specific video requirements.

### Processing the Video After Getting Quadrant and Colour Values

It extends the functionality to record events of balls entering and exiting quadrants. It reads the video, processes each frame for different colors, and writes timestamp, quadrant number, and ball color data to a CSV file ('output.csv').

#### Highlights:

- **CSV Output:** The script generates a CSV file ('output.csv') with the following format:
  Timestamp, Quadrant Number, Ball Colour
- **Frame Processing:** The video is processed frame by frame, and relevant data is recorded based on color and quadrant information.

Adjust color ranges, quadrant coordinates, and video file paths as needed for your specific application.

### Processing the Saved Data for Relevant Output

It is designed to clean up the CSV file generated by the previous script ('output.csv'). It removes redundant entries for each color, ensuring only the latest quadrant information is retained.

#### Highlights:

- **Data Cleaning:** Redundant entries for each color are removed, retaining only the latest quadrant information.
- **Output Formatting:** The script formats the cleaned data for better readability.

Feel free to explore the cleaned data and use it for relevant output or visualization.

Note:
Adjustments may be required in the color ranges, quadrant coordinates, and video file path based on the specific requirements of the video and the application. Please refer to the code comments for guidance.
